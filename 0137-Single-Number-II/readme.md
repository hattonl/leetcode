[Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *three* times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
